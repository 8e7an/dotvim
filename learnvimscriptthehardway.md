          Completed this unit but the resulting Vim script file grep-operator.vim is buggy despite
		  replicating the code in the article (even copied and pasted to be sure). Possibly something
		  to do with my configuation (even tried without my .vimrc `.vim -u NONE` but still no luck).
		  Maybe look into this again when my Vim script knowledge is further along.
